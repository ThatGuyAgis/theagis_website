***What is this project about?***

* This is the Homepage i use for my YouTube Channel.
My Viewers can get info about me and donate to support my work as well.

I am not a Web Developer, therefore this will probably be poorly coded, but i am open to suggestions!

In my free time i try to get the best out of it, will start developing a mobile app for my Youtube Channel as well. I am a Mobile Developer so that will probably be better coded.

***Future Plans:***

* Add a Mobile App to offer site's functionality with extras
* Include Javascript into the Site
* Improve Code Readibility - currently it is a mess
* Reduce File size for Graphical Images‚¡
* Develop an Extension for Browsers to notify user of a stream or a new youtube video
* Develop Site to Extend Functionality further.(maybe add "blog" functionality)





* I will update this File as anything important happens
